# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Approva Open Core.

## Before You Start

- keep changes scoped and practical
- do not redesign the product as part of unrelated work
- do not add hosted-cloud-only features to this repository
- if a change only makes sense for the hosted product, it should live separately

## Local Setup

Create local env files:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/approval-ui/.env.local.example apps/approval-ui/.env.local
```

Run local development:

```bash
make dev
```

Run the Docker self-host stack:

```bash
make start
```

Useful commands:

```bash
pnpm build
make smoke
pnpm cli:build
```

## Coding Expectations

- preserve the existing product shape and open-core behavior
- keep documentation, examples, and naming aligned with self-hosted open-core usage
- avoid leaving dead routes, broken imports, or half-removed code paths
- prefer focused changes with clear rationale
- update docs when the user-facing behavior changes

## Proposing Changes

1. Open an issue or discussion when the change is large, risky, or ambiguous.
2. Keep pull requests focused on a single problem when possible.
3. Describe what changed, why it changed, and how you tested it.
4. Include screenshots or terminal output when UI or operator workflows are affected.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before opening a PR, make sure you have:

- run the relevant local checks for your change
- updated docs or examples if needed
- kept the change within the scope of Approva Open Core
- avoided introducing hosted-commercial or cloud-operations-only surfaces
