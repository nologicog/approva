                Approva separates optional dashboard authentication from approval authentication.
                Console routes can use dashboard sign-in, while risky action approval still
                requires a secure approval link and passkey-authenticated human decision.

              <p>
                Machine access is separate again through organization-scoped API keys. These auth
                domains are intentionally not merged together.

                Approval requests can be paused, approved, rejected, expired, or auto-approved
                according to policy. Issued capabilities are opaque, scoped, expiring, and
                verified against action, resource, and params bindings.

                and deterministic ledger hash chain.

                Approva applies baseline security headers across the UI and API, including Content
                Security Policy, frame protection, content-type sniffing protection, referrer
                policy, and a restrictive permissions policy.

                Dashboard auth cookies stay on the app domain. Passkey approver-session cookies
                stay on the API domain. In production, both are expected to run over HTTPS so
                secure cookies are enabled automatically.
